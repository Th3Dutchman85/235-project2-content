With this website I wanted to use the REST api to display a certain countries facts and flag.  This went very well.
However, I was going to have the boardering countries clickable and be able to navigate that way as well, but after
making the function to do it I soon realized that I would need to reload the page everytime I searched for a new 
country.  Which was do-able but it would then mess up with the console logs.  Another error I ran into (the main
reason this feature was not present) was that the area codes that were clickable sometimes did not have a cooresponding
country.  So errors were thrown and weird countries were linked to that were not actually boardering the country.  This
happened because some countries, based on name, had the same three digit code.  So I would need to manually fix all
them.  That would have been a silly amount of code.  Aside from this however everything else is working fine and as
expected.  I learned how to do all of this through my IGME 235 course and from the W3C documentation.  In this
project I used three main sources:
-The REST api: https: restcountries.eu/
-Google Fonts: https: fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond?selection.family=EB+Garamond
-A picture of earth: https://altered-carbon.fandom.com/wiki/Earth

One of my favorite features is the dropdown menu for locating countries by continent.  I used JavaScript to change the text and
then I used css to display it.  I really liked this because I thought at the very end this looked very clean and added a lot to
the page. Thank you for reading and enjoy!
